This is a collection of xfce themes that I like to use when I 
am working on a system that has a graphical environment. I use
xfce almost exclusivly on linux systems if at all possible.
(Gnome classic sometimes). 

On xfce each theme folder should be placed in the standard gtk
theme directory: /usr/share/themes/

Then set the to the desired theme in the appearence panel, and 
change the window manger style.
